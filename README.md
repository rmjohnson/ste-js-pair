# Faithlife Hotels Survey Cypress Problem

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H11c5rJ4iey9lKar-iisn1Q78zsINdtwHORpqlqKS60/edit) is the link the specification. As pair of this problem you'll be converting those specifications to appropriate test cases (i.e. not each bullet point should correspond to a single test, that will be up to how you want to organize it).

Before your interview, make sure to:

- Clone this repo.
- Run `yarn` (or `npm install` if you prefer) to restore packages. This can take awhile for cypress.
- Run `yarn start` (or `npm run start`) and verify the page loads at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000). Please don't do anything beyond making sure the page loads before your interview.
- In a separate terminal, run `yarn cy:open` (or `npm run cy:open`) to start Cypress in interactive mode. Click `survey.js` to load up the test file and make sure the existing test case passes.

## Please Note

Again, please don't do any additional looking at the code or app before the interview. Your interviewer will be working with you as the "feature developer" so they'll be knowledgeable on the code and will help fix any bugs that come up.
